<h2>Narrative (Sprint 4 Retrospective)</h2>
<h3>What Went Well Sprint 4</h3>
<p>Our site is looking good! <a href="https://mgt656-patient-storm.herokuapp.com/">Check it out here!</a></p>
<p>Over the last few sprints, we did a good job getting everyone involved in the coding, migrating our sprint report to html, and building a working product. This sprint, we set a goal to improve our site's design and to keep up with design changes coming from our stakeholders. We had a goal to add our requests from the stakeholders into Waffle.io as they are requested. We didn't need to do that this week as there were no requests from our stakeholders.</p>
<p>This was a slower sprint for us. As it was Thanksgiving, we didn't advance our project as much. Dan didn't do any coding this week.</p>
<p>One area where we made some progress was in overall site design using CSS. It took some experimentation to get a Bootstrap template into the website, but Rob has a working version in progress on a separate unmerged branch. It will stay in beta during this sprint, but the objective is to push it to production by next sprint report (at least in some version)</p>
<p>We also have continued to use scrum in our group processes, continuing to set aside time for process reflection.</p>
<h3>Process Improvements to be Made Going Forward</h3>
<p>One adjustment to our process has been implementing the class time into our agile workflow. While a fifteen minute window in class is not the most effective or efficient time to get work done in the group, we have been gradually getting better at making use of those windows of time during class to do quick stand-ups and make sure we're on track for our sprint.</p>
<p>Going forward we will need to come up with a good way to parse out tasks once user stories become less discete; as well as ensure that we come up with a better system for responding to new stakeholder requests in a timely fashion.</p>
