<h2>Narrative (Sprint 3 Retrospective)</h2>
<h3>What Went Well Sprint 3</h3>
<p>Our site is looking good! <a href="https://mgt656-patient-storm.herokuapp.com/">Check it out here!</a></p>
<p>Over the last few sprints, we did a good job getting everyone involved in the coding, migrating our sprint report to htlm, and building a working product. This sprint, we set a goal to improve our site's design and to keep up with design changes coming from our stakeholders. We had a goal to add our requests from the stakeholders into Waffle.io as they are requested. We didn't need to do that this week as there were no requests from our stakeholders.</p>
<p>This was a slower sprint for us. As it was Thanksgiving, we didn't advance our project as much. Dan didn't do any coding this week.</p>
