<h2>Narrative (Sprint 3 Retrospective)</h2>
<h3>What Went Well Sprint 3</h3>
<p>Last sprint we did a great job of having everyone get involved with the coding. We also successfully migrated our sprint report platform to html.
</p>
<p>Matt added ids to the html elements on the event detail page. The lack of these was an oversight from his work during the previous sprint, and he has been thoroughly chastised for this.</p>

<p>Last sprint, we did a great job having everyone get involved with the coding. We also successfully migrated our sprint report platform to html. We continued those successes this sprint. Rob did the heaviest lift this sprint. He added the logic to redirect users to the new event detail page after they submit a new event. It was straightforward, but it generated two new problems that required more effort than anticipated to solve. First, he needed to add a piece of code to assign a new unique eventID to each new event. Second, he needed to debugged an issue where calling on a new event detail page caused the app to try and reload its own headers twice in a row, which threw an error. There was a FOR loop in the original master code that was missing an ELSE. Good coding Rob! Dan and Ayisha were particularly thankful that we didn't need to complete this story! After watching Kyle's video and getting help from John at office hours, Dan added code so that users can search and retrieve an object in an API with key events containing all events in JSON format. Ayisha was responsible for conducting the group reflection on our process, as well as completing the event expiration user story. While she was unable to get to the event expiration user story this sprint--it's taking longer than she expected--she's looking forward to completing it next sprint. Ayisha also led us in our reflection during our weekly meeting on Nov 16. Take a look at our list of meetings below.</p>
<h3>Process Improvements to be Made Going Forward</h3>
<p>Last sprint, we set a goal to have a designated person to monitor and submit the sprint reports every week, versus our previous practice of having this done by whoever volutneetered. This week, because we hadn't submitted our report by our weekly meeting on Monday night, we completed the report together--better than our previous approach but not our goal yet. We'll continue striving for that one next sprint.</p>
<p>Now, we're getting to the end of the discrete little coding tasks, so our job will change to improving the design and keeping up with design changes coming from our stakeholders. This week, we'll work on adding our requests from the stakeholders into Waffle.io. We'll try to have that job reside with the product owner, but because being the product owner is a tough gig (and because there isn't true conversation between the stakeholders and the product owner), we'll try to get the first person who sees them and have time to record these emails to Waffle.io.</p>
