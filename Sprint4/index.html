<h2>Narrative (Sprint 3 Retrospective)</h2>
<h3>What Went Well Sprint 3</h3>
<p>Last sprint we did a great job of having everyone get involved with the coding. We also successfully migrated our sprint report platform to html.
</p>
<p>Matt added ids to the html elements on the event detail page. The lack of these was an oversight from his work during the previous sprint, and he has been thoroughly chastised for this.</p>
<h3>Process Improvements to be Made Going Forward</h3>
<p>Going forward we think it will be better for our team to have a designated person to monitor and submit the sprint reports every week, versus our previous practice of having this done by whoever volutneetered. We also decided to have a designated product owner and scrum master, versus rotating this role every week. Dan volunteered to take on the role of monitoring and submitting our sprint reports, and Matt will continue to be the product owner, responsible for merging code. Ayisha will serve as designated scrum master. We will also have a designated time for code and sprint report edits to be submitted. </p>
