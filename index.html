    </ul>

<h2>Narrative of What We Accomplished This Sprint</h2>
<h3>Creating event detail pages</h3>
<p>We updated the app so that a user navigating to events/x, where x is the id of one of the events, will be directed to an event detail page for that event.

  This took a lot longer than expected, but it is working well.

<p>
  The reason that is took so long is that Matt had a bit of trouble understanding how local variables work and was thrown off by the fact that he wasn't sure how to reference the variable that was passed through to the event-detail.html view.
</p>

<p>
We also accomplished a few small tasks this sprint. We added the list of events to the homepage (even if this took much longer than expected because we were missing a comma in our code). We also created the infrastructure to build and submit our sprint reports in html. Initially, Dan used the code for homework 5 to build an create a Heroku app that would do this. Luckily, Matt realized that it is much easier to do this with Git, which is what we're doing now!</p>

<h3>Updating event list page</h3>
<p>We also updated the event list page to link to the event detail pages. This worked smoothly. You can see this in the below screenshot of a hover-over url tip.</p>
