<h2>Narrative of What We Accomplished This Sprint</h2>
<h3>Creating event detail pages</h3>
<p>We updated the app so that a user navigating to events/x, where x is the id of one of the events, will be directed to an event detail page for that event.

  This took a lot longer than expected, but it is working well.

<p>
  The reason that is took so long is that Matt had a bit of trouble understanding how local varialbes work and was thrown off by the fact that he wasn't sure how to reference the variable that was passed through to the event-detail.html view.

<h3>Updating event list page</h3>
<p>We also updated the event list page to link to the event detail pages. This worked smoothly. You can see this in the below screenshot of a hover-over url tip.</p>
