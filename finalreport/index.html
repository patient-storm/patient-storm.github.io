<h1>MSD Project -- Final Report</h1>

<h2>Team Name: Patient Storm</h2>

<h2>Members: Ayisha Devonish (ayisha.devonish@yale.edu), Dan Levis (dan.levis@yale.edu), Matt Hanna (matt.hanna@yale.edu), Robert Kimball (robert.kimball@yale.edu)</h2>

<h2>Date: December 11, 2015</h2>

<p>For our final project, we created a simple clone of Eventbrite. <a href="https://mgt656-patient-storm.herokuapp.com/">You can find our site here.</a></p>

<h2>Passing the automated test suite</h2>

<p>For this project, we used a test-driven development process where our coding was directing at passing a pre-determined series of tests, provided by the instructor (our "stakeholders"). We're thrilled to report that, as of the writing of this report, we've passed all of our tests, as shown in the image below.</p>

<h2>Business intelligence questions</h2>

<h2>Project maintenance</h2>

<p>This project was  to write an application allows users to create and RSVP for upcoming events - essentially a minimal clone of Eventbrite. Here is a description of the code.</p>

<p>Stepping into someone else's application and code is always challenging. Because we used the agile method of development, we did not spend time on unnecesary documentation. More than anything else, we believe in communication. So of course, your best resource is us. You are more than welcome to contact Ayisha Devonish (ayisha.devonish@yale.edu), Dan Levis (dan.levis@yale.edu), Matt Hanna (matt.hanna@yale.edu), and/or Robert Kimball (robert.kimball@yale.edu) for a walkthrough of the application, codes, and its capabilities today. In the event that we are unavailable, however, perhaps the best way to understand the capabilities of the application today is to review the tests that it passes (in tests.js or by running mocha). By reviewing the tests, a new developer stepping into the application will learn what we've built the application to do in its current form. Our sprint reports, which you also can access, have a wealth of information about the development process, issues, solutions, etc.</p>

<p>A few general points about project mechanics. This project largely relies on open source projects of which we suspect you are quite familiar. It is a node.js application, and it uses the following components:</p>

  <ul>
         <li>express.js: This is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.</li>
         <li>nunjucks: This is a templating language for JavaScript.</li>
        <li>morgan: This is a HTTP request logger middleware for node.js. It is written by the same people who write Express.</li>
        <li>validator: This is a a library of string validators and sanitizers that helps to ensure that parameters sent to our application by users are valid.</li>
        <li>body-parser: This is a Node.js body parsing middleware. It is also written by the same people who write Express.</li>
      </ul>

<p>A few other general points:</p>

  <ul>    
        <li>The tests run by using mocha (use the command "mocha")</li>
        <li>Today, the application runs on Heroku</li>
        <li>You can find our Github repository for the project <a href="https://github.com/patient-storm/mgt656-spring-2015-project">here.</a></li>
        <li>Every page uses the Bootstrap CSS framework</li>
        <li>Our site has an API at /api/events and is able to retrieve an object with key events containing all events in JSON format</li>
    </ul>

<p>Hope that this is enough to get you going. If not, please do reach out to us in the future.</p>

<h2>What we learned about management in general and agile in particular</h2>

<p>The last requirement we got from our stakeholders was to do some analysis of how small changes in our website could change user behavior. We decided to answer these strategic questions using A/B testing and Google Analytics. This proved to be a technical challenge for us! One of the biggest issues we encountered was that it was difficult to tell when we had properly implemented the testing code. Our method required bypassing a few of Google Analytics' built in tools, and every test essentially required pushing all the way to production. We were disappointed to see in the end that our test for swapping the word "Donate" for "Support" did not work properly due to bugs in our code. That said, our test for whether adding "RSVP" to our events list influenced behavior worked perfectly.</p>
