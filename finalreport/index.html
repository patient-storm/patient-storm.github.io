<h2>Passing the automated test suite</h2>

<p>For this project, we used a test-driven development process where our coding was directing at passing a pre-determined series of tests, provided by the instructor (our "stakeholders"). We're thrilled to report that, as of the writing of this report, we've passed all of our tests, as shown in the image below.</p>
